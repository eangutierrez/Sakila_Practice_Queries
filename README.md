## Business Task
* Created a MySQL script to highlight some of the MySQL querying skills I learned while studying _Learning SQL Third Edition_ by Alan Beaulieu.
* Set up a database and SQL editor to interact with the database, upload the schema, and dump tables.
* Practiced several intermediate and advanced SQL skills, including querying multiple tables, conditional logic, views, common table expressions, and analytic functions.
